# C++ Test Case Generator 🧪

A simple Python script to automatically generate input (`.in`) and output (`.out`) test cases for your C++ competitive programming solutions. ✨ Streamline your testing process! 🚀

## 🤔 What it does

This script takes your C++ solution file and an input template file, then:

1.  Compiles your C++ solution using `g++`.
2.  Reads the `.txt` template.
3.  Generates a specified number of `.in` files based on the template, replacing special placeholders with random values.
4.  Runs your compiled C++ solution against each generated `.in` file.
5.  Captures the output and saves it to corresponding `.out` files.
6.  Organizes all generated test cases into a `cases/` directory.

## ✨ Why Use This Script?

*   **⚡️ Save Time:** Instantly generate dozens or hundreds of test cases instead of creating them manually.
*   **📝 Easy Configuration:** Use a straightforward `.txt` file to specify the format and random ranges for your inputs.
*   **🎲 Versatile Randomization:** Supports both random integers and floats to cover different scenarios.
*   **⚙️ Seamless Workflow:** Integrates compilation (`g++`) and execution of your C++ solution directly into the generation process.
*   **✅ Guaranteed Correctness (Based on your solution):** Generates `.out` files by running *your* trusted solution, ensuring outputs match the expected logic.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

*   Python 3 🐍
*   A C++ compiler (specifically `g++`) installed and accessible in your PATH. ⚙️
*   ⚠️ **Linux/Unix Environment Recommended**: This script uses shell commands (`cat`, `|`, `>>`) that are standard in Linux and macOS environments. While it might be adaptable for Windows (e.g., using WSL, Git Bash, or MinGW environments), it's **designed and tested primarily for Linux** and may not work out-of-the-box on Windows.

## 🚀 Usage

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get the `main.py` script into your project directory.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ooraul/TestGenCpp
    cd TestGenCpp
    # Or just download main.py
    ```
2.  **Prepare Your C++ Solution:** Place your correct C++ solution code in a file named `solution.cpp` in the same directory as `main.py`.
3.  **Create an Input Template:** Create a file named `input.txt` in the same directory. This file will define the structure of your input files and specify where random values should be inserted.
4.  **Define Placeholders in `input.txt`**.
5.  **Run the Script:** Execute the Python script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```
6.  **Enter Number of Test Cases:** The script will prompt you:
    ```
    Enter the number of test cases to generate:
    ```
    Type the desired number (e.g., `10`) and press Enter.
7.  **Check the Results:** The script will output logs as it works. Once finished, you'll find a `cases/` directory containing the generated `N.in` and `N.out` files. 🎉

## 📝 Input Template Format (`input.txt`)

The `input.txt` file serves as the blueprint for your generated `.in` files. The script reads this file and intelligently replaces special placeholders with random values while copying static text directly.

**Placeholders:**

Use these tags to insert random data:

*   `%i[min-max]`: Generates a random **integer** (inclusive range).
    *   *e.g., `%i[1-10]`*
*   `%f[min-max]`: Generates a random **float**.
    *   *e.g., `%f[2.5-4]`*

All other text is copied exactly as it appears.

**See it in Action:**

➡️ **For a concrete example demonstrating how to structure your template with both placeholders and static text, please refer to the examples included in the root of this repository.**

## 🔧 Customization

*   You can change the default filenames (`SOLUTION_FILENAME`, `INPUT_FILENAME`) at the top of the `main.py` script if needed.
